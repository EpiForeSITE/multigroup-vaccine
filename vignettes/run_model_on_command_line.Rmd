Consider a population with the following parameters:

-   Two sub-populations, one with size 80000 (A) and the other with size 20000 (B)

-   At time 0, vaccinate 30% of A and 20% of B

-   Set the reproductive number 1.75

-   Recovery rate of 1/7 creates a time to symptom resolution of 1 week.

-   Relative contact rates are 1 and 1.7. This is the overall contact rates of groups A and B relative to each other. This means that an individual in Group B makes 1.7 contacts for every 1 made by an individual in group A.

-   Contact within group is set to 0.2 for A, 0.5 for B. This is the fraction of all contacts that are A-\>A, or B-\>B respectively.

-   Relative susceptibility is the susceptibility to infection per contact of individuals in each group relative to each other. With relative susceptibility = (1, 1), they are equally susceptible.

```{r}
multigroup.vaccine::getFinalSize(vacTime = 0,
  vacPortion = c(0.3, 0.2),
  popSize = c(80000, 20000),
  R0 = 1.75,
  recoveryRate = 1 / 7,
  relContact = c(1, 1.7),
  contactWithinGroup = c(0.2, 0.5),
  relSusc = c(1, 1))
```

```
[1] 15145.987  8710.351
```

More than half as many individuals in population B are infected at the end of the simulation, despite the fact that they are outnumbered 4 to 1 by population A.
