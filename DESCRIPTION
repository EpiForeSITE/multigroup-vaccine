Description: Model infectious disease dynamics in populations 
    with multiple subgroups having different vaccination rates, transmission
    characteristics, and contact patterns. Calculate final and intermediate
    outbreak sizes, form age-structured contact models with automatic fetching
    of U.S. census data, and explore vaccination scenarios with an interactive
    'shiny' dashboard for a model with two subgroups, as described in Nguyen et
    al. (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.jval.2024.03.039> and Duong et al. (2026)
    <doi:10.1093/ofid/ofaf695.217>.
