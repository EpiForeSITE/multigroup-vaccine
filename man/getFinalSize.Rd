\title{Calculate final size of outbreak: the total number of infections in each group}
\usage{
getFinalSize(
  vacTime,
  vacPortion,
  popSize,
  R0,
  recoveryRate,
  contactRatio,
  contactWithinGroup,
  suscRatio
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vacTime}{time after first case at which all vaccinations are delivered}

\item{vacPortion}{fraction of each population vaccinated}

\item{popSize}{size of each population}

\item{R0}{overall basic reproduction number}

\item{recoveryRate}{inverse of mean infectious period
(same time units as vacTime)}

\item{contactRatio}{ratio of 2nd group's : 1st group's overall contact rate}

\item{contactWithinGroup}{fraction of each group's contacts that are
in-group vs out-group}

\item{suscRatio}{ratio of 2nd group's : 1st group's susceptibility to infection per contact}
